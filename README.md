I like to use GitHub as my playground. Here is where I like to try and build things with technologies that caught my attention.

‚ùó I don't have any work repositories here; all the projects here are things that came out of my mind or were inspired by another app or website. <br>
‚ùó Although I can work full stack, my focus is on Frontend Technologies. <br>

**FAQ:** <br>
**What editor do you use?** <br>
VS Code. <br>

**What theme do you use in VS Code?** <br>
None in particular, I change every now and then. <br>

**What plugins do you use in your editor?** <br>
A bunch! <br>

**What program do you use for your diagrams?** <br>
Excalidraw. <br>

**What are your thoughts on Angular?** <br>
Good Framework, but too bloated for most cases. Also, I think Nextjs beats Angular in everything, in my opinion. <br>

**What are your thoughts on other JS Frameworks?** <br>
I think they are very interesting; although some of them are more of the same, others are quite innovative, and they are trying to push the limits even further. The JS community and ecosystem make me excited! <br>

**What languages do you code in?** <br>
Javascript and Typescript. <br>

**Why do you like Javascript?** <br>
I love its ecosystem, there are a bunch of crazy and innovative people pushing the language to the limit! <br>

**Why do you like Typescript?** <br>
It's JS, but improved! In my opinion <br>

**TS over JS always?** 
Although I love Typescript, I think JS is enough for most projects. <br>

**What OTHER languages do you code in?** <br>
I have coded in Python and Java, mostly for work, but I wouldn't say I KNOW Python and Java... <br>

**Would you be willing to learn a new programming language?** <br>
Absolutely! I even think about a few, but for now I'm going to stick with the JS ecosystem. <br>

**Do you like Backend development?** <br>
Yes, I do. Although I find Frontend development to be more enjoyable and rewarding. <br>

**Ok, you're a Frontend Developer, get it. Now, what about your design knowledge?** <br>
My design knowledge is very lacking, I usually pick designs made by professional designers instead of creating one from scratch. But I intend to improve my design knowledge! <br>

**Do you have any kind of interest in other IT areas (QA, DevOps, Cybersecurity, Machine Learning)?** <br>
Not really... I have software development as a job and a hobby too. <br>

**What's your goal as a Software Engineer?** <br>
Being capable of developing high-quality applications, no matter if it's on the Web, Mobile or Desktop. <br>

**What's your philosophy for choosing a technology?** <br>
I usually choose the easiest and minimal route to get things done, even if it's not the most OPTIMAL route. Using cross-platform technologies instead of going fully Native, for example <br>

**Do you use AI in your workflow?** <br>
YEP! Mostly chatGPT.<br>

**Linux, Mac, or Windows?** <br>
I don't really care üòõ <br>

**Android or IOS?** <br>
Android ü§ñ <br>

**Chrome or Firefox?** <br>
I use Brave, so... Chrome I guess lol <br>
