# Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is Richard Schmidt
## Front-end/UI Software Engineer

I like to use GitHub as my playground. Here is where I like to try and build things with technologies that caught my attention.

I don't have any work repositories here; all the projects here are things that came out of my mind or were inspired by another app or website.

Although I can work Full Stack (Frontend & Backend using Typescript), **my focus is on Frontend Technologies**.
