👋 Hi, I’m Richard Schmidt, and I like to use GitHub as my playground. Here is where I like to try and build things with technologies that caught my attention.
- I don't have any working repository here; all the projects here are things that came out of my mind or were inspired by another app or website.
- If you want to know more about me, visit my Linkedin profile at www.linkedin.com/in/richard-schmidt16.

My favorite Technologies:
🔥 React/Nextjs
🔥 Typescript
🔥 CSS Modules + PostCSS
🔥 Vite
🔥 Nodejs/Express
🔥 MongoDB

I also love:
✨ VanillaJS (obviously 😁)
✨ Preact
✨ Sass
✨ Css-in-js
✨ Bootstrap
✨ Webpack

<!---
Richard-S16/Richard-S16 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
