Hi 👋 My name is Richard Schmidt
================================

Front-end Software Engineer
---------------------------
I like to use GitHub as my playground. Here is where I like to try and build things with technologies that caught my attention.

❗ I don't have any work repositories here; all the projects here are things that came out of my mind or were inspired by another app or website. <br>

❗ Although I can work Full Stack (Frontend & Backend using Typescript), **my focus is on Frontend Technologies**. <br>

❗ I'm used to working with modern Design Tools, e.g. Figma/Adobe XD/Canva. But I'm **NOT** a **UI/UX Designer**<br>

❗ If you want to know more about me, visit my LinkedIn profile <br>
