👋 Hi, I’m Richard Schmidt, and I like to use GitHub as my playground. Here is where I like to try and build things with technologies that caught my attention.

❗ I don't have any working repository here; all the projects here are things that came out of my mind or were inspired by another app or website. <br>
❗ Although I can work as a Full Stack, my focus is on Frontend Technologies. <br>
❗ If you want to know more about me, visit my Linkedin profile at www.linkedin.com/in/richard-schmidt16. <br><br>


My favorite Technologies: <br>
🔥 React/Nextjs <br>
🔥 Typescript <br>
🔥 CSS Modules + PostCSS <br>
🔥 Nodejs/Express <br>
🔥 MongoDB <br><br>


I also love: <br>
✨ VanillaJS (obviously 😁) <br>
✨ Preact <br>
✨ Sass <br>
✨ Css-in-js <br>
✨ Bootstrap <br>
✨ Electron <br>
✨ Vite <br>


Technologies I want to try: <br>
⚡ React Native <br>
⚡ Framer Motion <br>
⚡ TailwindCSS <br>
⚡ GraphQL <br>
⚡ Dart + Flutter <br>
⚡ Cypress <br>
⚡ PostgreeSQL <br>
⚡ Prisma <br>
⚡ Tauri <br>
⚡ Zod <br>
