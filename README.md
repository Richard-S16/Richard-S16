ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Richard Schmidt, and I like to use GitHub as my playground. Here is where I like to try and build things with technologies that catch my attention.
- I don't have any working repository here; all the projects here are things that came out of my mind or were inspired by another app or website.
- If you want to learn more about me, visit my Linkedin profile at www.linkedin.com/in/richard-schmidt16.Â 

<!---
Richard-S16/Richard-S16 is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
