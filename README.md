ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Richard Schmidt and I like to use GitHub as my playground. Here is where I like to test and build things with technologies that took my attention.
- I don't have any working repository here, all the projects here are things that came out of my mind or some inspiration from another App or Website.
- If you want to know more about me check my Linkedin: www.linkedin.com/in/richard-schmidt16

Richard-S16/Richard-S16 is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
