# Hi 👋 My name is Richard Schmidt
## Front-end/UI Software Engineer

I like to use GitHub as my playground. Here is where I like to try and build things with technologies that caught my attention.

I don't have any work repositories here; all the projects here are things that came out of my mind or were inspired by another app or website.

Although I can work Full Stack (Frontend & Backend using Typescript), **my focus is on Frontend Technologies**.

I'm used to working with modern Design Tools, e.g. Figma/Adobe XD/Canva. But I'm **NOT** a **UI/UX Designer**<br><br>

🌍  I'm based in Brazil
