I like to use GitHub as my playground. Here is where I like to try and build things with technologies that caught my attention.

❗ I don't have any working repository here; all the projects here are things that came out of my mind or were inspired by another app or website. <br>
❗ Although I can work full stack, my focus is on Frontend Technologies. <br>
❗ If you want to know more about me, visit my Linkedin profile <br>
❗ You can also get in touch with me at richard_s16@protonmail.com <br><br>


My favorite Technologies: <br>
🔥 React/Nextjs <br>
🔥 Typescript <br>
🔥 CSS Modules + PostCSS <br>
🔥 Nodejs/Express <br>
🔥 MongoDB <br><br>

✨ VanillaJS (obviously 😁) <br>
✨ Preact <br>
✨ Sass <br>
✨ Css-in-js (Styled Components/styled-jsx) <br>
✨ Bootstrap <br>
